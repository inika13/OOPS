OOPS:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software.
It helps make programs modular, reusable, maintainable, and scalable.

Class → Blueprint/template for creating objects.

Object → Instance of a class that holds actual data and behavior.

1) INHERITANCE :
      1)Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (child/derived class) inherits the members (fields, properties, methods) of another class (parent/base class).
      2)It helps in code reusability, method overriding, and hierarchical classification.
